## COMP520 ProjectD by Aliya Goncalves Almeida & Maya Elysse

### What we did:
All steps from ProjectC were completed, running with no issues.

### How to verify:
The way to verify each step of this project, you can go to the main() on our kernel.c file.
There you can see all the function that were called on each step.
For example, if you would like to check step 1, you can just uncomment step 1 from the main
and leave the other steps commented and then compile it and run it on the java simulator.
Therefore, you can do the same thing for the other steps.
Or, you can use any of the shell commands: dir, create, type, copy, execute, and delete.
